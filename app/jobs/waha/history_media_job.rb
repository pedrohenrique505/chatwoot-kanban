  # Small pause between fetches so a chat's media trickles out instead of pounding
  # the (shared) WAHA session back to back. Applied as an enqueue delay rather than
  # a sleep so the worker thread is not pinned while it waits.

  # Downloads media for one chat's already-written history messages and attaches
  # it, best-effort. Runs off the import's critical path (text lands fast) and
  # serially (one job per chat); idempotent — skips messages that already have an
  # attachment, so a retry is safe.
  #
  # One message per execution: a chat's media fetches are each capped at
  # FETCH_TIMEOUT, but a chat with hundreds of them would otherwise hold a single
  # Sidekiq thread (and its database connection) for over an hour, and an import
  # enqueues one of these per chat. Chaining keeps the same serial, throttled
  # behaviour while bounding a thread to a single fetch.
  #
  # The current item only leaves the queue on :success or :terminal — a
  # :transient failure (network blip, WAHA 5xx) leaves it at the front so the
  # next run (after the throttle, or the circuit-breaker cooldown) retries the
  # very item that failed instead of skipping past it.
