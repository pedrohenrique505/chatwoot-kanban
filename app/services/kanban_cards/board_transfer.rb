# the same rules: the destination has to accept the card's inbox and must not already hold the
# same card; the reason and the stage the card could be reopened into are cleared, because both
# belong to the funnel being left; custom field values are remapped onto the destination's
# fields by signature and dropped when it has none; and the timeline follows the card, so
# deleting the funnel it left cannot take the history along.
