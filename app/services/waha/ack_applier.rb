# Applies one WhatsApp delivery receipt to the exact Chatwoot message, multipart
# part and send attempt it belongs to, so the bubble's delivery indicator — still
# the agent-facing presentation — converges monotonically.
#
# Two GOWS traits shape this (see `receiptToMessageAck` in WAHA's
# session.gows.core.ts, which turns a whatsmeow receipt into `message.ack` for a
# direct chat and `message.ack.group` for a group):
#
#   * GOWS never emits SERVER (ack 1). whatsmeow receipts only carry DEVICE,
#     READ, PLAYED and server-error, so `sent` always comes from our own send
#     confirmation and never from a receipt.
#   * A group receipt is emitted per participant and carries no roster and no
#     participant count, so "delivered to / read by everyone" — what a group's
#     ticks mean in WhatsApp itself — cannot be derived from the receipt stream.
#     We keep the real granularity the payload does have (the participant) in
#     content_attributes['waha_group_acks'] and let the bubble mean "at least one
#     participant reached this state". A group receipt without a participant has
#     no usable granularity at all: it is logged and changes nothing.
